{"data": [{"content": "In adaptive filtering the least mean square LMS type algorithms are widely used but suffer from slow convergence for colored signals The affine projection AP algorithm 1 was proposed to speed up the convergence which produces a good tradeoff between the convergence speed and the complexity Due to the good properties several variants of the AP algorithm have been developed in the context of blind multiuser detection 2 acoustic echo cancellation AEC 3 and 4 active noise control ANC 5 and acoustic feedback cancellation AFC 6 When the projection order P increases the convergence rate of the AP algorithm is improved at the price of a considerable rise of the computational complexity Many efforts have been made to reduce the complexity of the AP algorithm 3 4 5 6 7

9 10 11 12 13 14 15 and 16 present a fast approximate filtering FAF scheme to reduce the complexity Since the FAP algorithm is based on an implicit small regularization parameter assumption the FAP algorithm is not exactly equal to the standard AP algorithm 17 Most of the existing fast AP type algorithms 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 and 16 are based on the FAF approach The FAF approach reduces the complexity efficiently but also leads to degraded performance To overcome this limitation a fast exact filtering FEF approach to the AP algorithm FEAP 18 was presented by Y Zakharov However in the FEAP algorithm calculation of the error vector requires the update of the weight vector explicitly that provides the largest contribution towards the algorithm complexity Many AP type algorithms 19 20 and 21 adopt the FEF approach to reduce the complexity and have a similar problem In many applications such as AEC and ANC calculation of the weight vector is not the main concern 3 4

to that of the FAP algorithm We then extend the proposed FEF approach to a family of AP type algorithms such as the dichotomous coordinate descent DCD AP 18 affine projection sign APS 22 and modified

convergence and tracking behavior of the EFEAP and original FAP 3 and 4 algorithms The impulse response is changed at the middle of the iterations To achieve the fastest convergence the step size is set to math_begin 1 0 math_end It is seen that the EFEAP has faster convergence rate than the original FAP algorithm However the steady state misadjustment of the original FAP algorithm is smaller than that of the EFEAP algorithm with the same step size which is an interesting discovery and worthwhile of further study Also it is well recognized that the original FAP algorithm suffers from numerical instability especially in a fixed point implementation because of the propagating errors 13 and 14 These facts demonstrate the strengths of the proposed algorithm ", "header": "3"}]}
